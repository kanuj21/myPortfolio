                I'm a passionate <span className="text-mycolor">Full Stack Developer</span> with a strong 
                foundation in <span className="text-mycolor">Java, Spring Boot, React, Next.js</span>, and modern 
                web technologies. Though my career journey faced a pause due to personal and medical reasons, 
                my passion for coding never wavered. Over the past few years, I have continuously honed my skills, 
                solving over <span className="text-mycolor">600+ DSA problems</span> on platforms like LeetCode and 
                GeeksforGeeks, refining my problem-solving abilities and deepening my understanding

            <p className="mt-4 mb-4">            
                I have built several projects that showcase my expertise in both backend and
                 frontend development. <span className="text-mycolor">My User Management System</span>, developed 
                 with and React, demonstrates my ability to create efficient, scalable applications. 
                 I'm also actively developing my portfolio website 
                 using <span className="text-mycolor">Next.js</span> and <span className="text-mycolor">Tailwind CSS</span>, pushing myself to 
                 integrate new features and enhance user experience. Additionally, 
                 I built a <span className="text-mycolor">SuperHero App</span> that leverages JavaScript and external <span className="text-mycolor">APIs</span> to deliver engaging functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, I am ready to embark on my professional journey 
                as a <span className="text-mycolor">Full Stack Developer</span>. I thrive in environments that 
                challenge me to learn and grow, and I am looking for an opportunity with a company that 
                values dedication, curiosity, and a problem-solving mindset. My hunger for learning and adaptability 
                ensures that I not only meet expectations but exceed 
                them. <span className="text-mycolor">Let's build something amazing together!</span>
